# Advent of code 2016
Here you can find my solutions to the problems presented in the coding-problem advent calendar [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

## Folder structure
The solutions are in the folder `src/` where the solution to the 1st problem is in the folder `src/a1`.

The tests, and all test data should be contained in `test`, where the tests for the 1st problem (and associated data) should be contained in `test/a1`.

## Initialize project
To initialize the project, and download all its dependencies, run:
```
yarn install
```

## Tests
Run `yarn test` to run all tests.

To run a specific test, such as all tests for problem 1, run `env SUBFOLDER=a1 yarn test`.
